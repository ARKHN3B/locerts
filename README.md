# Locerts - Local Certificates Generator

[![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)](./LICENSE.txt)

This GitHub project give you a utility script that generates local certifications for your computer.

The script is written in Bash, and it uses OpenSSL to generate the certificates.

The script takes in a few inputs from a config.yml file.

Once the inputs are provided, the script generates the certificate files and stores them in a designated directory on your computer. The user can then use these certificates for various purposes, such as securing local web applications or testing local SSL/TLS connections.

The project includes detailed documentation on how to use the script, along with examples and troubleshooting tips. It also includes a license and a contribution guide for other developers who may want to contribute to the project.

#### Important notes
1. This script works only on macOS for the moment. Come and contribute to make this script available for Linux and Windows ðŸ¤—.
2. This script is not intended to be used in production. It is only intended to be used for local development purposes.
3. This script doesn't work for multiple domains. Come and contribute to make this script available for multiple domains ðŸ¤—.



## To do
- [ ] Make the script available for Linux
- [ ] Make the script available for Windows
- [ ] Add logic for multiple domains in the config.yml file (array) and in the script (for loop)


## Documentation
